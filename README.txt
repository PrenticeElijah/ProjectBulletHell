Bullet Hell Project

My ultimate goal with this game was to gain a better understanding about 2D movement in Unity, familiarize myself with the Unity workspace more, and dip my toes into project management and the game development process. I chose Galaga and the Touhou series as inspiration for two reasons. Firstly, I would be able to focus much more on essential movements for the player (specifically on mobile for this project) and the bullets fired by both the player and the enemy instead of other features such as level design. After this, I would be able to draw in my inspiration from Touhou and experiment with different bullet patterns using the knowledge I gained after completing my first task. It's here where I had the most difficulty.

The bullet patterns in games like Touhou are very complex and difficult to replicate. My goal wasn't to recreate the most complex and visually stunning pattens. All I wanted to do was try to make patterns other than the automatic linear fire I created for the player. The BasicStar pattern script mainly required me keeping track of time in-game. That way, the enemy is not constantly firing bullets. The scripts for the spiral patterns were a lot more difficult. Each one required that the enemy kept track of every bullet spawner attached to it, and knowing when to fire from each one. Creating these patterns was a fun challenge and I plan to do more experimental and creative projects like this in the future.

This project also served as an introduction to implementing UI into Unity through the 'Game Over' screen. This allowed me to restart the game by reloading the scene. This restart function also made testing easier, as I would not need to exit the game every time I wanted to replay it. I intend to implement this knowledge in my future projects as well.
